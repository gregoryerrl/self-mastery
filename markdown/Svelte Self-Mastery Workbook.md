## How to Use This Workbook

This document is **not a Svelte tutorial**. It assumes you understand component basics.

Instead, it gives you the **deep questions and challenging projects** that will make you a Svelte expert who can use it anywhere, modify it, and build anything.

### Here's how to use it effectively:

#### 1. **Ask Yourself First**

- Try to answer each question from first principles
- Understand how Svelte's compiler works
- Explain concepts without looking at documentation

#### 2. **Leverage Resources**

- Official [Svelte documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs)
- [Svelte source code on GitHub](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)
- Svelte REPL for experiments
- Svelte Society resources
- Rich Harris talks

#### 3. **Build Everything from Scratch**

- Before using a Svelte feature, understand what the compiler generates
- After using it, examine the compiled output
- Understand the trade-offs Svelte makes

#### 4. **Use Svelte Everywhere**

- Build Svelte components in vanilla JS apps
- Integrate Svelte into other frameworks
- Create components that work universally
- Test Svelte's boundaries

#### 5. **Modify and Extend**

- Don't just use Svelte - customize it
- Build preprocessors and plugins
- Create compiler extensions
- Contribute improvements

---

## üå± Philosophy Behind This Workbook

### This is a **"master the tool completely"** document.

- The **questions** push you beyond surface-level usage

- **Be curious** ‚Üí always ask "what does the compiler generate?"

- The **exercises** require understanding Svelte's compilation first

- **Compare constantly** ‚Üí Svelte vs virtual DOM vs other approaches

- **Push boundaries** ‚Üí use Svelte in unconventional ways

- **Contribute back** ‚Üí understand Svelte well enough to improve it

By completing this workbook, you won't just "know Svelte." **You'll understand Svelte so deeply that you can use it anywhere, modify it for any use case, build components that work in any framework, and contribute to Svelte itself.**
