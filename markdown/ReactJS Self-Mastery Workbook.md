- Create components that work universally
- Test React's boundaries

#### 5. **Modify and Extend**

- Don't just use React - customize it
- Build plugins and extensions
- Create custom renderers
- Contribute improvements

## üå± Philosophy Behind This Workbook

### This is a **"master the tool completely"** document.

- The **questions** push you beyond surface-level usage

- **Be curious** ‚Üí always ask "how does React implement this internally?"

- The **exercises** require building React features from scratch first

- **Compare constantly** ‚Üí React vs your implementation vs other solutions

- **Push boundaries** ‚Üí use React in unconventional ways

- **Contribute back** ‚Üí by the end, you'll understand React well enough to improve it

By completing this workbook, you won't just "know React." **You'll understand React so deeply that you can use it anywhere, modify it for any use case, build components that work in any framework, and contribute to React itself.**
