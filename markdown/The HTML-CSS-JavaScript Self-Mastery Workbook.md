## How to Use This Workbook

This document is **not a textbook**. It will not hand you the answers.

Instead, it gives you the **right questions to ask yourself** â€“ questions every developer must be able to answer to master the topic at a global standard.

### Here's how to use it effectively:

#### 1. Ask Yourself First

- Before looking things up, try to explain the answer in your own words
- If you can't, that's fine â€“ it means you found a gap in your knowledge
- If a new question pops up in your own mind that's not in here, that's your curiosity leading you deeper â€“ write it down and explore it

#### 2. Leverage All Resources

- Use Google, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT to research
- Read documentation, articles, and examples
- Find a way to practice and produce results
- Experiment! Break things and see what happens

#### 3. Learn by Doing

- Each section has project exercises
- Completing these exercises forces you to practice and discover the answers naturally
- Don't skip them â€“ doing is how you'll turn "theory" into mastery

#### 4. Reflect and Explain

- After finding an answer, try teaching it back:
  - Explain to a friend, or a fellow developer
  - Write notes in your own words
  - Or even record yourself explaining
- If you can explain clearly, you've truly learned it

#### 5. Iterate and Improve

- Revisit questions regularly
- As you grow, your answers will become deeper and more precise

---

## ðŸŒ± Philosophy Behind This Workbook

### This is a **"find the answer within yourself"** document â€“ the web development version.

- The **questions** represent the knowledge every web developer must internalize

- **Be curious** â†’ always ask "why does this work this way?"

- The **resources** (Google, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT) are your tools â€“ but the true goal is that **the understanding lives inside you**, not just in your search history

- The **exercises** are opportunities to struggle, explore, and discover

- **Expect mistakes** â†’ debugging is how you learn

- **Reflect** â†’ explain new concepts in your own words

### Questions Grow With You

This workbook starts with the absolute basics:

- **Foundational questions** - What is this? Why does it exist?
- **How-to questions** - How do I use this?
- **Deep questions** - Why does it behave this way?
- **Scenario questions** - How do I solve this real problem?

By the time you've asked and answered everything here â€“ and built the exercises â€“ you won't just "know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript." **You'll understand them so deeply that you can build, debug, and explain any project with confidence.**

# HTML

---

## Section 1: What is HTML? Understanding Web Documents

### Understanding HTML

- What is HTML, and what problem does it solve? (Why can't we just open a Word document in a browser?)
- When you visit a website, what is your browser actually reading and displaying?
- What does "markup language" mean? How is it different from a programming language?
- Why do we need a special language just to structure content?
- What does "HyperText" mean in HTML? What makes it different from plain text?

### Document Structure Basics

- What does `<!DOCTYPE html>` tell the browser? What happens if you forget it?
- Every HTML document has `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Why are there three parts? What goes in each one?
- You write text directly in a file and open it in a browser. You write the same text in an HTML file with `<html>` tags. What's the difference in how the browser displays them?
- What's the difference between opening a `.txt` file and a `.html` file in a browser?

### Tags and Elements

- What are "tags"? Why do most tags come in pairs (opening and closing)?
- You write `<p>Hello` but forget to close it with `</p>`. Does it still work? What problems might this cause?
- Some tags don't have closing tags (like `<br>` and `<img>`). Why? What makes them different?
- What's the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`? Try putting each on a page â€“ how do they display differently?
- What are "attributes" in HTML tags? How do you add them to a tag?

### Your First HTML Page

- How do you create an HTML file? What extension does it need?
- You create a file called `index.html` and double-click it. What happens?
- How do you view the HTML source code of any website you visit?
- What does "View Page Source" show you? How is it different from the pretty website you see?

### Build It: Your First "Hello World" Webpage

Create your very first HTML document:

**Requirements:**

1. Create a new file called `index.html`
2. Add the basic HTML structure:

   - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
   - `<html>` tags wrapping everything
   - `<head>` section with a `<title>`
   - `<body>` section with content

3. Inside the `<body>`, add:

   - A heading that says "Hello World"
   - A paragraph introducing yourself
   - A `<div>` with some text
   - A `<span>` with some text
   - A line break (`<br>`)

4. Open the file in your browser and view it
5. Right-click and "View Page Source" â€“ see your code!

**Experiment:**

- What happens if you forget the closing `</html>` tag?
- What happens if you put content in the `<head>` instead of `<body>`?
- Try removing the `<!DOCTYPE html>` â€“ does anything change?
- What happens if you nest tags incorrectly: `<p><div></p></div>`?

### Reflection

After building:

- Why do browsers need a special language (HTML) to display content?
- What's the purpose of having `<head>` and `<body>` as separate sections?
- When might you use `<div>` versus `<span>`?
- Why do some tags need closing tags and others don't?

---

## Section 2: Structuring Content with HTML

### The Problem

You have text content â€“ paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes â€“ and you need to structure it so browsers and search engines understand what each piece means. Without structure, everything is just plain text with no hierarchy or meaning.

### Headings and Hierarchy

- What are heading tags (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)? Why are there six levels?
- You have a blog post with a title, section titles, and subsection titles. Which heading tags should you use for each?
- What happens if you use `<h1>` for your main title and then `<h4>` for the next heading? Does it work? What problems might it cause?
- How do screen readers use headings to help blind users navigate a page?
- Can you have multiple `<h1>` tags on one page? Should you?

### Paragraphs and Text Formatting

- What's the difference between `<p>` and `<br>`? When should you use each?
- You want to make some text bold. You could use `<b>` or `<strong>`. What's the difference? When does it matter?
- What's the difference between `<i>` and `<em>`? They both make text italic â€“ so why have both?
- How do you highlight text like a marker would on paper?
- How do you show text that's been deleted or added (like in a document with tracked changes)?

### Lists and Structured Content

- What's the difference between ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`)?
- Your list has nested sub-lists (a list inside a list). How do you create this structure?
- When should you use a list versus separate paragraphs?
- What is a description list (`<dl>`)? When would you use it?

### Grouping Content

- What is a `<div>` and why is it called a "division"?
- You want to group some paragraphs together. Should you wrap them in a `<div>`, a `<section>`, or something else?
- What's the difference between `<div>` and `<section>`? Do they display differently?
- How do you add a line break between content sections?

### Build It: Blog Article About Yourself

Create a structured blog post introducing yourself:

**Requirements:**

1. **Document Title**

   - `<h1>` for the main title: "About Me"

2. **Sections with Headings**

   - Use `<h2>` for section titles: "My Background", "My Interests", "My Goals"
   - Use `<h3>` for subsections if needed

3. **Paragraphs**

   - Write at least 3 paragraphs about yourself
   - Use `<p>` tags properly
   - Use `<strong>` to emphasize important points
   - Use `<em>` for subtle emphasis

4. **Lists**

   - Create an ordered list of your top 5 goals
   - Create an unordered list of your hobbies
   - Create a nested list (maybe your hobbies with sub-items)

5. **Formatting**
   - Use `<mark>` to highlight one key phrase
   - Use `<del>` and `<ins>` to show something you changed your mind about
   - Use `<blockquote>` for a favorite quote
   - Use `<code>` if you mention any technical terms

**Experiment:**

- Try different heading levels â€“ does the browser display them differently?
- Create a list with 3 levels of nesting
- Leave out closing tags â€“ what happens?
- Use multiple `<br>` tags in a row â€“ how does spacing work?

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is using heading hierarchy important beyond just making text bigger or smaller?
- When should you use semantic tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`) versus style tags (`<b>`, `<i>`)?
- How does proper structure help search engines understand your content?
- What makes a list more appropriate than paragraphs for certain content?

---

## Section 3: Links, Images & Media

### The Problem

Text-only pages are boring. You need to add images, videos, and links to other pages. The web is called the "web" because pages link to each other. Without links and media, you just have isolated documents.

### Understanding Links

- What is a hyperlink? What makes it "hyper"?
- What does the `<a>` tag stand for? (Hint: not "link")
- You want to link to another page. What attribute tells the browser where to go?
- What's the difference between `href="about.html"` and `href="https://google.com"`? (Relative vs absolute URLs)
- How do you make a link open in a new tab? Should you always do this?
- How do you create a link that jumps to a specific section on the same page?
- What's the difference between `<a>` and `<button>`? When should you use each?

### Working with Images

- What is the `<img>` tag? Why doesn't it have a closing tag?
- What does `src` stand for? What does this attribute do?
- You add an image, but it's way too big and breaks your layout. How do you control the size?
- What is `alt` text? Why is every image supposed to have it?
- Your image file doesn't exist or the path is wrong. What does the browser display?
- What's the difference between `<img>` and CSS `background-image`? When should you use each?

### Adding Videos and Audio

- How do you embed a video in your page with the `<video>` tag?
- What's the difference between embedding a video file and embedding a YouTube video?
- What are video controls? How do you add play/pause buttons?
- How do you add an audio player to your page?
- What's the purpose of including multiple `<source>` elements inside a `<video>` tag?

### Figures and Captions

- You have an image that needs a caption underneath. How do you group them together semantically?
- What's the difference between just putting text under an image versus using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`?
- Can you use `<figure>` for things other than images?

### Build It: Personal Portfolio Page

Create a portfolio page with links and media:

**Requirements:**

1. **Navigation Links**

   - Create a navigation menu at the top
   - Link to different sections: Home, About, Projects, Contact
   - Use anchor links to jump to sections on the same page

2. **External Links**

   - Link to your social media profiles (or fake ones)
   - Make external links open in new tabs
   - Add at least 3 external links

3. **Images**

   - Add a profile picture (use placeholder if you don't have one)
   - Add at least 3 project images
   - Give every image meaningful `alt` text
   - Make sure images aren't ridiculously huge

4. **Figures with Captions**

   - Wrap your project images in `<figure>` tags
   - Add `<figcaption>` describing each project

5. **Media**
   - Embed a video (use a sample video file or YouTube embed)
   - Add video controls
   - (Optional) Add an audio file with a player

**Experiment:**

- What happens if you forget the `alt` attribute?
- Try setting image width with attributes vs CSS
- Break an image link â€“ what does the browser show?
- Try different YouTube embed options
- Create a clickable image (put `<img>` inside `<a>`)

### Reflection

After building:

- Why does the web use hyperlinks? What would the internet be like without them?
- Why is `alt` text important beyond just accessibility?
- When should you link to another page versus create anchor links on the same page?
- What's the difference between embedding media and linking to it?

## Section 4: Forms & User Input

### The Problem

You need to collect information from users: login credentials, search queries, contact messages, survey responses. Forms are how users send data to your website. Understanding forms is essential for building interactive websites.

### Understanding Forms

- What is an HTML form? What happens when you submit a form?
- What does the `<form>` tag do? Why do you need it?
- What's the difference between `method="get"` and `method="post"`?
- What does the `action` attribute do? Where does form data go when submitted?
- What happens if you press Enter while typing in a form?

### Input Types

- What is an `<input>` tag? Why are there so many types?
- What's the difference between `type="text"`, `type="email"`, and `type="password"`?
- You want users to select a date. What input type do you use?

- How do you create a dropdown menu where users select one option?
- How do you create a large text area for longer messages?

### Labels and Accessibility

- What is a `<label>` tag? Why should every input have a label?
- You click on the label text and the input focuses. How does this work?
- What's the relationship between the label's `for` attribute and the input's `id`?
- Why is this relationship important for accessibility?

### Form Validation

- What does `required` do? Try submitting a form without filling in a required field.
- How do you set minimum and maximum values for a number input?

### Buttons and Submission

- What's the difference between `<button>` and `<input type="button">`?
- What does `type="submit"` do? How is it different from a regular button?
- You have a form with multiple buttons. How do you prevent them all from submitting the form?
- What does `type="reset"` do? When is it useful?

### Build It: Contact Form with Validation

Create a working contact form:

**Requirements:**

4. **Advanced Inputs**

   - Contact preference: radio buttons (Email, Phone, Either)
   - Newsletter signup: checkbox
   - Best time to contact: time picker
   - Date of inquiry: date picker

5. **Validation**

   - Mark required fields with `required`
   - Email must be valid format
   - Message must be at least 10 characters (minlength)
   - Phone must match a pattern (optional: use pattern attribute)

6. **Submission**
   - Submit button at the bottom
   - Reset button to clear the form
   - Try submitting â€“ what happens?

**Experiment:**

- What happens when you submit without filling required fields?
- Try entering an invalid email â€“ what does the browser do?
- Click on labels â€“ do the inputs focus?
- Remove all labels â€“ how does it affect usability?
- Try tabbing through the form â€“ does it work logically?

### Reflection

After building:

- Why are labels important beyond just showing text next to inputs?
- What's the difference between client-side validation (HTML/JavaScript) and server-side validation?
- When should you use a checkbox versus radio buttons?
- How do forms make the web interactive rather than just informational?

---

## Section 5: Tables & Structured Data

### The Problem

You have data that naturally fits in rows and columns: price comparisons, schedules, statistics, grades, product specifications. Tables display this structured data clearly and let users scan and compare information efficiently.

### Understanding Tables

- What is a table? When should you use a table versus a list?
- What are the main parts of a table: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`?
- What does each abbreviation mean? (tr = table row, td = table data, th = table header)
- Why should you never use tables for page layout? (They used to be used this way â€“ what changed?)

### Table Structure

- What's the difference between `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`? Why have three sections?
- When should you use `<th>` versus `<td>`?
- How do you create a table with headers both at the top AND on the left side?
- What is the `scope` attribute? Why is it important for accessibility?

### Spanning Cells

- You want one cell to stretch across multiple columns. What attribute do you use?
- What's the difference between `colspan` and `rowspan`?
- You're creating a calendar table. How do you make cells span multiple days?
- What happens if your colspan/rowspan math doesn't add up correctly?

### Table Captions and Accessibility

- What is a `<caption>` element? Where does it go in the table?
- Why should tables have captions?
- How do screen readers announce table data? How does proper structure help?

### Build It: Student Grade Table

Create a comprehensive grade table:

**Requirements:**

1. **Basic Grade Table**

   - Table with student names, 3 assignment scores, midterm, final, and total
   - Use `<thead>` for header row with `<th>` elements
   - Use `<tbody>` for student data rows with `<td>` elements
   - Use `<tfoot>` for average row at the bottom
   - Add a `<caption>` describing the table

2. **Scope Attributes**

   - Add `scope="col"` to column headers
   - Add `scope="row"` to student names (if names are in first column)

3. **Spanning Cells**

   - Create a "Assignments" header that spans 3 columns
   - Create a "Exams" header that spans 2 columns
   - Group related columns with merged headers

4. **Styling Context** (using attributes)

   - Add alternating background colors using CSS or style attribute
   - Highlight the header row
   - Make the footer row stand out

5. **Second Table: Schedule**
   - Create a weekly class schedule
   - Days of week as columns
   - Time slots as rows
   - Use rowspan for classes longer than one period
   - Use colspan for classes across multiple days

**Experiment:**

- Try removing `<thead>` and `<tbody>` â€“ does it still work?
- Make a cell span wrong (colspan="2" but you want 3 columns)
- Try nesting a table inside a table cell
- Remove all `<th>` tags and use `<td>` â€“ how does it affect readability?

### Reflection

After building:

- When is a table the right choice versus a list or other structure?
- Why is semantic table structure important for accessibility?
- How does `scope` help screen reader users understand table relationships?
- What makes colspan and rowspan powerful but potentially confusing?

---

## Section 6: Semantic HTML & Accessibility

### The Problem

Two websites can look identical but be completely different in their HTML structure. One uses `<div>` for everything, the other uses semantic HTML. Search engines and screen readers can understand the semantic one but struggle with the `<div>`-soup. Accessibility isn't optional â€“ it's a core requirement for professional web development.

### Understanding Semantic HTML

- What does "semantic" mean? How is `<header>` more semantic than `<div id="header">`?
- Why should you care about semantics if you can style a `<div>` to look like anything?
- How do search engines use semantic HTML to understand your page?
- What's wrong with using `<div>` and `<span>` for everything?

### Semantic Structure Elements

- What's the difference between `<div>` and `<section>`?
- When should you use `<article>` versus `<section>`?
- What is `<header>` for? Can you have multiple `<header>` elements?
- What goes in a `<nav>` element? Should all links be in `<nav>`?
- What is `<main>`? How many `<main>` elements should a page have?
- What is `<aside>` for? What kind of content belongs in it?
- What is `<footer>` for? Can you have multiple footers?

### Landmarks and Navigation

- What are "landmark" elements? How do screen reader users use them?
- How does a blind user jump directly to the main content of your page?
- What is a "skip to content" link? Why is it important?
- Why should your page have a logical heading structure?

### Accessibility Basics

- What does "accessibility" (a11y) mean in web development?
- Why should every image have an `alt` attribute?
- Your navigation uses icon buttons with no text. How do screen reader users know what they do?
- What is ARIA? When should you use ARIA attributes?
- What is keyboard navigation? Why must your site work without a mouse?
- What is focus? How do you make focus visible to keyboard users?

### ARIA Attributes

- What does `aria-label` do? When do you need it?
- What is `aria-hidden`? When should you hide content from screen readers?
- What are `aria-live` regions? When do you need them?
- What does `role` attribute do? When should you avoid using it?
- What is `aria-current`? How does it help with navigation?

### Build It: Accessible News Article Page

Create a complete, accessible news article:

**Requirements:**

1. **Semantic Structure**

   - `<header>` for the site header (logo, main navigation)
   - `<nav>` for navigation menu
   - `<main>` for the main content area (only one per page)
   - `<article>` for the news article
   - Multiple `<section>` elements within the article
   - `<aside>` for related links or sidebar
   - `<footer>` for copyright and footer links

2. **Heading Hierarchy**

   - One `<h1>` for the article title
   - `<h2>` for major sections
   - `<h3>` for subsections
   - No skipped heading levels

3. **Navigation**

   - Create a "Skip to main content" link at the very top
   - Navigation menu with current page indicated
   - Use semantic `<nav>` element
   - Add `aria-current="page"` to current page link

4. **Images and Media**

   - All images have descriptive `alt` text
   - Decorative images have `alt=""`
   - Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images with captions

5. **Forms (if included)**

   - All inputs have `<label>` elements
   - Error messages are associated with inputs
   - Required fields are marked

6. **Keyboard Navigation**

   - All interactive elements are reachable with Tab
   - Focus is visible (don't remove outline without replacement)
   - Logical tab order (top to bottom, left to right)

7. **ARIA Enhancements**

   - Add `aria-label` to icon buttons
   - Use `aria-live="polite"` for dynamic content updates
   - Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative icons

8. **Content**
   - Use `<strong>` and `<em>` for semantic emphasis, not just styling
   - Use `<time>` for dates with `datetime` attribute
   - Use `<address>` for contact information

**Testing Requirements:**

- Navigate the entire page using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter)
- Use a screen reader (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
- Validate HTML with W3C validator
- Check with WAVE accessibility tool

**Experiment:**

- Replace semantic elements with `<div>` - how does screen reader experience change?
- Remove all `alt` attributes - what does screen reader announce?
- Remove focus indicators - can you navigate with keyboard?
- Skip heading levels (h1 to h4) - what problems does this cause?

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is semantic HTML important beyond just "looking the same"?
- How do search engines benefit from semantic structure?
- What's the difference between making something look accessible and actually being accessible?
- When should you use ARIA versus using semantic HTML?

# CSS

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner: What is CSS? Styling Basics

- What is CSS, and what problem does it solve?
- Why is styling separated from HTML? What if they were combined?
- What does "Cascading Style Sheets" mean? What is "cascading"?
- What's the difference between presentation and structure?
- Before CSS existed, how did people make websites look good? Why did they need CSS?

### Adding CSS to HTML

- What are the three ways to add CSS to HTML? (Inline, Internal, External)

### Understanding Specificity

- You have two rules targeting the same element with different colors. Which color wins?
- What makes one selector more "specific" than another?
- Why does `#header` win over `.header`?
- You have a rule on `p` and another on `.intro`. Which one applies to `<p class="intro">`?
- What is the specificity order: element, class, ID, inline style?
- How do you check which styles are actually applied to an element?

### The Cascade

- Three rules target the same element with the same specificity. Which one wins?
- What does "last one wins" mean?
- What is inheritance? Which properties inherit and which don't?
- Your `<body>` has `color: blue`. Does the color apply to all text on the page?

### Build It: Style Your Portfolio Page

Take your HTML portfolio from before and add CSS:

**Requirements:**

1. **Set Up CSS**

   - Create a `styles.css` file
   - Link it to your HTML with `<link>` in the `<head>`
   - Test that it's connected (change body background color)

2. **Typography**

   - Change the font family for the entire page
   - Style all headings with a different color
   - Make your `<h1>` bigger than the browser default
   - Change paragraph font size
   - Adjust line-height for readability

3. **Colors**

   - Set a background color for the page
   - Set a different background color for your header section
   - Make links a specific color
   - Change link color on hover

4. **Selectors Practice**

   - Use element selectors (all `<p>` tags)
   - Use class selectors (add classes to elements first)
   - Use ID selectors (add an ID to one element)
   - Use descendant selectors (`.nav a` for links inside navigation)

5. **Specificity Challenges**
   - Style a paragraph with a class differently from other paragraphs
   - Create a style conflict and see which rule wins
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect which styles are applied
   - Override a style by making a more specific selector

**Experiment:**

- Add inline styles - do they override your external CSS?
- Create two conflicting rules with the same specificity
- Make a typo in a property name - what happens?
- Try to style an element but your CSS doesn't apply - debug why
- Change the order of rules in your CSS - does anything change?

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is external CSS better than inline styles for large projects?
- How does the cascade decide which styles to apply?
- Why does specificity exist? What problems would occur without it?
- How do you debug CSS when styles don't apply as expected?

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate: Layout & Positioning

### The Problem

Your elements stack vertically like a text document. You need elements side-by-side, centered, positioned exactly where you want them. You need grids, flexbox layouts, navigation bars, sidebars, and footers. Understanding layout is what separates a plain document from a real website design.

### Understanding the Box Model

- What is the CSS box model?
- What's the difference between content, padding, border, and margin?
- You set `width: 200px` on a div. Then you add `padding: 20px` and `border: 5px`. How wide is the div now?

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Animate `transform` and `opacity` only
   - Use `will-change` for frequently animated elements
   - Minimize CSS file size
   - Inline critical CSS (above-the-fold styles)

**Media Query Breakpoints:**

```css
/* Mobile first: base styles */
/* Tablet: 768px and up */
/* Desktop: 1024px and up */
```

**Testing Requirements:**

- Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Test at random sizes between breakpoints
- Ensure no horizontal scroll at any size
- Test with slow network (DevTools throttling)

**Experiment:**

- Remove viewport meta tag - what happens on mobile?
- Try animating `width` versus `transform` - feel the difference
- Use only fixed widths - watch it break
- Remove media queries - how does mobile look?
- Add hundreds of complex selectors - test performance

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is mobile-first development often better than desktop-first?
- Which CSS properties can you safely animate without performance issues?
- How do you balance responsive design with performance?
- When should you use `em` versus `rem` versus `px`?
