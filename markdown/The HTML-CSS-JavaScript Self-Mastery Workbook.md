## How to Use This Workbook

This workbook teaches you HTML, CSS, and JavaScript **deeply** - not just "how to use them" but **how they work and why they behave the way they do**.

### The Goal

After completing this workbook, you'll be able to:

✅ **Build professional websites from scratch**  
✅ **Debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript issues intuitively**  
✅ **Understand web standards and best practices**  
✅ **Make informed decisions about web technologies**  
✅ **Be prepared for framework learning** (React, Vue, etc.)

### The Structure

Each section follows this pattern:

#### 1. **The Problem / Real Scenario**

Why does this concept matter? You'll see a real situation where this knowledge is critical.

#### 2. **Explorable Questions**

Questions designed to make you **think, research, and discover** - not memorize definitions.

**Good questions look like:**

- ✅ "You're building a registration form. Users complain they can't see which field is selected. How do you make focus states visible and accessible?"
- ✅ "Your website looks perfect on desktop but breaks on mobile. What CSS techniques ensure your layout adapts to any screen size?"
- ✅ "A button click should fetch data from an API, but sometimes the user clicks twice before the first request completes. How do you prevent duplicate requests?"

**Bad questions look like:**

- ❌ "What is semantic HTML?" (too vague, just memorization)
- ❌ "What does CSS stand for?" (trivia, not understanding)
- ❌ "List all HTML5 tags" (memorization, not useful)

#### 3. **Build It**

Every section has hands-on exercises where you **build something real**. You'll struggle, research, debug, and discover the answers naturally.

#### 4. **Reflect**

After building, you'll reflect:

- What did you discover?
- How does this connect to real-world development?
- What patterns did you notice?

### How to Approach Each Section

1. **Read "The Problem"** - Understand why this matters
2. **Try answering questions yourself first** - before Googling
3. **Research using all tools** - Google, ChatGPT, MDN, Stack Overflow
4. **Build the exercises** - Don't skip these, they're where real learning happens
5. **Experiment and break things** - See what happens when you change code
6. **Teach it back** - Explain to someone or write notes in your own words

---

## 🌱 Philosophy Behind This Workbook

### Core Beliefs

- **Deep understanding > Surface knowledge** - You'll learn WHY things work, not just HOW to use them
- **Discovery > Memorization** - Questions guide you to discover, not just recall facts
- **Building > Reading** - You'll build everything from scratch
- **Practical > Theoretical** - Every concept ties to real problems you'll face
- **Tool-agnostic** - Use ChatGPT, Google, Stack Overflow - whatever helps you learn

### The Learning Path

```
Face a real problem → Research and explore → Build something → Break it →
Fix it → Understand why it works → Reflect → Repeat
```

By the time you complete this workbook, you won't just "know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" - you'll **understand them so deeply that building websites becomes intuitive, debugging becomes obvious, and learning frameworks becomes easy**.

# HTML

---

## Section 1: Document Structure & Semantics

### The Problem

You're building a website. The browser needs to understand what your document is, what language it's in, what character encoding it uses, and how to structure the content. Without proper document structure, your page might break in different browsers, fail accessibility checks, or not appear in search results properly.

### Explorable Questions

- Your HTML page displays random characters instead of text. The console shows encoding errors. What declaration are you missing, and where does it go?
- You need to add a title that appears in the browser tab, meta description for Google, and viewport settings for mobile. Where do these go, and why can't they be in the `<body>`?
- You're copying HTML from an old website. It has no `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration. What problems might this cause, and why do modern browsers need this line?
- You have a `<div>` with text and a `<span>` with text. They display differently. One starts on a new line, one doesn't. What's the fundamental difference between these elements?
- You're creating a template that shouldn't render immediately but can be cloned with JavaScript. What HTML element lets you define hidden reusable content?
- You're building a multi-page site. Every page needs the same header and footer HTML. How do you avoid copy-pasting? What's the difference between `<template>`, server-side includes, and JavaScript-based solutions?

### Build It: Multi-Page Website Foundation

Build a small 3-page website foundation (home, about, contact):

**Requirements:**

1. Create a proper HTML5 document structure for each page
2. Use correct DOCTYPE, character encoding, and viewport meta
3. Add unique page titles and meta descriptions
4. Create a `<template>` for a reusable card component
5. Use JavaScript to clone and populate the template
6. Demonstrate the difference between block and inline elements
7. Add at least 3 void elements (img, br, hr, input, meta)
8. Ensure all pages validate with W3C HTML Validator

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Create a navigation menu that appears on all pages
- Highlight the current page in the navigation
- Use semantic HTML for the navigation structure

### Reflection

After building:

- Why does the DOCTYPE matter even though it looks like just one line?
- What happens if you forget the `<meta charset>`?
- When would you use a `<template>` vs just creating elements with JavaScript?
- How do block vs inline elements affect page layout?

---

## Section 2: Content & Media Elements

### The Problem

Your website needs text content (headings, paragraphs, lists), images, videos, and links. Users need to navigate between pages and see media content. Search engines need to understand your content hierarchy. Screen readers need to announce content meaningfully.

### Explorable Questions

- Your article has a main title, section titles, and subsection titles. If you use `<h1>` for the main title, what happens if you jump straight to `<h4>` for a section? Why do screen reader users complain?
- You're adding an image of your product. Google Images doesn't show it in search results. Screen readers skip over it. What attribute are you missing, and what should go in it?
- Your video file is 50MB. Users on slow connections complain it takes forever to load. How do you optimize video delivery? What's the difference between `<video>`, `<iframe>` embedding, and progressive streaming?
- You want to create a clickable image that links to a product page. Do you put `<img>` inside `<a>`, or `<a>` inside `<img>`? What's the correct nesting?
- You're building a documentation site. Some links should open in the same tab, others in a new tab, and some should download files. How do you control link behavior?
- Your list of steps must be numbered, but your list of features shouldn't be. What's the semantic difference, and which HTML elements do you use?

### Build It: Blog Article Page

Create a complete blog article with rich content:

**Requirements:**

1. Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) for title, sections, and subsections
2. Multiple paragraphs with proper text formatting (strong, em, mark, code)
3. Both ordered and unordered lists
4. Images with proper alt text and captions
5. External links (to other sites) and internal links (to page sections)
6. Embedded video with fallback content
7. Audio player for a podcast excerpt
8. Blockquotes with citations
9. Code snippets using `<pre>` and `<code>`
10. Abbreviations and acronyms with `<abbr>`

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Create a table of contents with anchor links to sections
- Add responsive images that load different sizes based on viewport
- Implement lazy loading for images and video

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is heading hierarchy important beyond just visual appearance?
- What happens if an image fails to load? How does alt text help?
- When should you use `<strong>` vs `<b>`, or `<em>` vs `<i>`?
- How do you decide between embedding video vs linking to YouTube?

---

## Section 3: Forms & User Input

### The Problem

Your website needs to collect user input: login credentials, registration forms, search queries, contact messages, file uploads. Forms must validate input, provide helpful error messages, work with keyboards, and submit data securely.

### Explorable Questions

- Users type their email address, but they make a typo. The form accepts it, and the confirmation email never arrives. How do you validate email format before submission?
- Your password field shows typed characters. Anyone looking at the screen can see the password. What input type prevents this?
- Users complain they can't use Tab to navigate your form, and clicking labels doesn't focus the inputs. What's the relationship between `<label>` and input elements?
- Your search form has one input and one button. When users press Enter, nothing happens. They must click the button. Why doesn't keyboard submission work?
- You're building a signup form. You need: email, password, confirm password, birthdate, country dropdown, terms checkbox. The password must be at least 8 characters. Passwords must match. All fields are required. How do you implement this validation on both client and server side?
- Users want to upload profile pictures, but they accidentally select videos or documents. How do you restrict file types? What happens if they try to upload a 50MB file?

### Build It: Complete Registration System

Build a multi-step registration form with validation:

**Requirements:**

1. **Step 1: Account Info**

   - Email input with validation
   - Password with requirements (min length, show/hide toggle)
   - Confirm password with match validation
   - Real-time validation feedback

2. **Step 2: Personal Info**

   - Full name (required)
   - Date of birth (date picker with age validation: 18+)
   - Gender (radio buttons)
   - Country (dropdown/select)

3. **Step 3: Preferences**

   - Interests (multiple checkboxes)
   - Profile picture upload (file input with preview)
   - Bio (textarea with character counter)

4. **Step 4: Terms**
   - Terms and conditions checkbox (required)
   - Submit button (disabled until all validation passes)

**Validation Requirements:**

- Email format validation
- Password strength indicator
- Matching password confirmation
- Required field indicators
- Real-time validation messages
- Prevent submission of invalid forms
- Accessible error messages (ARIA)

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Add autofocus to the first input
- Implement form data persistence (LocalStorage)
- Add a progress indicator showing which step users are on
- Make the form keyboard-navigable
- Add custom styling for :valid and :invalid states

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is client-side validation not enough? When do you need server-side validation?
- How do you make error messages helpful vs frustrating?
- What's the difference between `required`, pattern validation, and JavaScript validation?
- How do you prevent duplicate form submissions?

---

## Section 4: Data Tables & Structured Content

### The Problem

You need to display tabular data: pricing tables, comparison charts, schedules, dashboards, product specifications. Tables must be readable, sortable, responsive on mobile, and accessible to screen readers.

### Explorable Questions

- Your pricing table has 10 columns. On mobile, it's unreadable and users must scroll horizontally forever. How do you make tables responsive without breaking the data structure?
- Screen reader users hear "row 5, column 3" but don't know what the column represents. They heard the header 15 rows ago. How do you associate data cells with their headers programmatically?
- Your table has merged cells for category headers. Some cells span 2 rows, others span 3 columns. How do you code this structure?
- You're building a data table for a university transcript. Some rows are course names (headers), others are grades (data). Some columns show both credit hours and letter grades. How do you structure this semantically?
- Users want to sort your table by different columns: name alphabetically, price numerically, date chronologically. How do you implement client-side sorting without a framework?
- Your table displays 1000 rows of data. The page is slow and crashes on mobile. How do you paginate or virtualize table rows?

### Build It: Interactive Data Dashboard

Create a student grade dashboard with sortable tables:

**Requirements:**

1. **Student Roster Table**

   - Headers: Student ID, Name, Email, Status, Actions
   - Body: Multiple student rows with data
   - Footer: Total count, average GPA

2. **Course Grades Table**

   - Headers: Course Code, Course Name, Credits, Grade, Points
   - Use `colspan` for merged header cells
   - Use `rowspan` for category groupings
   - Include `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`

3. **GPA Calculation Table**
   - Semester | Courses | Credits | GPA
   - Show semester-by-semester breakdown
   - Use proper `scope` attributes for accessibility

**Interactive Features:**

- Click column headers to sort (ascending/descending)
- Search/filter rows by student name
- Show/hide columns on mobile
- Add row hover effects
- Highlight selected row

**Accessibility Requirements:**

- Proper `scope` attributes on headers
- `caption` element describing the table
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for sorting

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Export table data to CSV
- Add pagination (show 10 rows at a time)
- Implement editable cells
- Create a responsive card view for mobile

### Reflection

After building:

- When should you use a table vs a list or div layout?
- What's the difference between `scope="col"` and `scope="row"`?
- How do you decide when to use `<tfoot>` for summary data?
- What are the accessibility trade-offs of hiding table columns on mobile?

---

## Section 5: Accessibility & Semantic HTML

### The Problem

20% of users have disabilities. Your website must work for people who are blind (screen readers), have motor impairments (keyboard-only navigation), are deaf (captions for videos), have cognitive disabilities (clear language, simple layouts), or use assistive technologies.

Additionally, search engines rely on semantic HTML to understand and rank your content. Proper semantics benefit both humans and machines.

### Explorable Questions

- You've built a beautiful navigation menu, but screen reader users hear "link, link, link, link" without context. How do you provide semantic meaning to navigation?
- Users complain they can't see which button is focused when tabbing through your form. What CSS pseudo-class shows focus, and why does removing focus outlines for aesthetics break accessibility?
- You're building a "Loading..." state that updates dynamically when content loads. Sighted users see the change, but screen reader users don't hear it. What ARIA attribute announces dynamic content changes?
- Your article has a main content area, a sidebar with related links, and a footer. How do you semantically mark these regions so screen readers can jump directly to main content?
- You've created an icon button (no text, just an icon). Screen readers announce it as "button" with no context. How do you provide meaningful labels without visible text?
- Your form shows an error message when validation fails. The message appears below the input, but screen reader users don't hear it. How do you associate error messages with form fields programmatically?

### Build It: Fully Accessible News Website

Create an accessible news article page with proper semantic structure:

**Requirements:**

1. **Document Structure**

   - Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
   - Proper heading hierarchy (only one h1)
   - Skip-to-content link for keyboard users
   - Landmark regions properly labeled

2. **Navigation**

   - Keyboard accessible menu
   - Current page indicated (aria-current="page")
   - Meaningful link text (not "click here")
   - Visible focus indicators

3. **Article Content**

   - Semantic HTML (article, section, figure, figcaption)
   - Images with descriptive alt text
   - Videos with captions and transcripts
   - Proper use of strong/em for meaning, not styling

4. **Interactive Elements**

   - Form with labels and error messages
   - Button vs link (correct semantic usage)
   - ARIA labels for icon buttons
   - ARIA live regions for dynamic content

5. **Accessibility Features**
   - Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
   - Font size adjustable (no fixed px for text)
   - Content readable without CSS
   - Keyboard navigation works everywhere
   - Focus order makes logical sense

**Testing Requirements:**

- Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
- Navigate entire page with keyboard only (no mouse)
- Validate with WAVE accessibility checker
- Check color contrast with browser DevTools
- Verify with axe DevTools extension

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Add dark mode with prefers-color-scheme
- Implement reduced motion for animations
- Add language switching with proper lang attributes
- Create a text-only version

### Reflection

After building:

- What's the difference between `<div>` and `<section>`? When does it matter?
- Why do semantic HTML elements improve both accessibility AND SEO?
- What ARIA attributes did you use most? When should you avoid ARIA?
- How does proper focus management improve keyboard navigation?

## 🟢 Beginner: CSS Foundations

### The Problem

You've built HTML structure, but it looks like a plain text document from 1995. You need to style elements: colors, fonts, spacing, borders. You need to select specific elements without affecting others. You need to understand why some styles apply and others don't when rules conflict.

### Explorable Questions

- You add `color: red` to a `<div>`, but the text inside a `<p>` stays black. You add it to the `<p>`, and now it's red. Why don't all elements inherit all properties?
- You style a button with a class, but the browser's default button style overrides it. What's specificity, and how do you calculate which rule wins?
- Your stylesheet has three rules targeting the same element: one with an ID, one with a class, one with an element selector. Which style applies?
- You set `font-size: 1em` on a paragraph inside a div that has `font-size: 20px`. The text is 20px. You set it to `1rem` instead. Now it's 16px. What's the difference?
- You're viewing someone else's website. You inspect an element and see crossed-out styles in DevTools. What does that mean, and why are some styles ignored?
- Your site looks different in Chrome vs Firefox vs Safari. How do you reset or normalize styles across browsers?

### Build It: Personal Portfolio Landing Page (Styled)

Take a plain HTML portfolio page and style it from scratch:

**Requirements:**

1. **Typography**

   - Choose and apply web fonts (Google Fonts)
   - Set font sizes using relative units (rem, em)
   - Style headings, paragraphs, and lists
   - Apply proper line-height and letter-spacing

2. **Color Scheme**

   - Define a color palette (CSS variables)
   - Apply colors to text, backgrounds, borders
   - Ensure proper color contrast
   - Create hover states for interactive elements

3. **Box Model**

   - Apply margin, padding, border to elements
   - Understand content-box vs border-box
   - Create card components with proper spacing
   - Use box-shadow for depth

4. **Selectors & Specificity**

   - Use element, class, and ID selectors
   - Combine selectors (descendant, child, sibling)
   - Use pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus, :nth-child)
   - Use pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)
   - Resolve specificity conflicts

5. **CSS Organization**
   - External stylesheet (main.css)
   - Logical section organization (reset, typography, layout, components)
   - CSS comments for documentation
   - Consistent naming convention

**Styling Challenges:**

- Style the first letter of paragraphs differently (::first-letter)
- Create custom list markers with ::before
- Add decorative elements with ::after
- Style alternating table rows with :nth-child
- Create button hover and active states
- Style form inputs with :focus, :valid, :invalid

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) throughout
- Create a CSS reset or use normalize.css
- Implement a print stylesheet
- Add transition effects to interactive elements

### Reflection

After building:

- Why does specificity exist? What problems would occur without it?
- When should you use ID selectors vs class selectors?
- What's the cascade, and how does it determine which styles apply?
- How do relative units make your design more flexible?

---

## 🟡 Intermediate: Layout & Visual Design

### The Problem

Your webpage is just a vertical stack of elements. You need multi-column layouts, centered content, sidebars, grids, cards arranged in rows. You need elements positioned exactly where you want them. You need flexible layouts that adapt to content and screen size.

### Explorable Questions

- You want three cards side-by-side that automatically wrap to a new row on smaller screens. Should you use Flexbox or Grid? What's the difference?
- Your navbar should stick to the top when users scroll down. You try `position: fixed` but it overlaps content. Then you try `position: sticky` but it doesn't work. What's the difference, and what parent requirements does sticky need?
- You're building a dashboard: header, sidebar, main content area, footer. The sidebar should be fixed height, and main content should scroll. How do you structure this layout?
- Your centered div has `margin: 0 auto` but doesn't center. What's missing?
- You have 12 product cards. You want exactly 4 per row with equal spacing. When you add a 13th card, it should wrap. Which layout technique is best?
- Text is overflowing its container. You've set `width: 200px` but the text doesn't wrap. What property controls text overflow behavior?

### Build It: Responsive Dashboard Layout

Create a complete dashboard with multiple layout techniques:

**Requirements:**

1. **Header (Fixed)**

   - Logo on left, navigation on right
   - Stays at top when scrolling

   - Fixed width: 250px
   - Uses Flexbox column layout
   - Icons and text labels

3. **Main Content (Grid Layout)**

   - Adjusts based on sidebar
   - CSS Grid for dashboard widgets
   - Multiple card components
   - Proper spacing and gaps

4. **Cards/Widgets**

- Create equal-height columns
- Position a button in the top-right corner of a card
- Layer multiple elements with z-index
- Create a "holy grail" layout
- Implement a masonry-style image gallery

**CSS Techniques Required:**

- Flexbox (justify-content, align-items, flex-wrap, flex-grow)
- CSS Grid (grid-template-columns, grid-gap, grid-area)
- Positioning (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky)

- Box model manipulation
- Float clearing (clearfix)

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Make sidebar collapsible
- Add smooth transitions to layout changes
- Implement a modal overlay
- Create a dropdown menu
- Add a hamburger menu for mobile

### Reflection

After building:

- When should you use Flexbox vs Grid? Can you use both together?
- What's the difference between `position: absolute` and `position: fixed`?
- How does the box model affect layout calculations?
- What problems does `position: sticky` solve that fixed and absolute can't?

## 🔵 Advanced: Responsive & Performance

### The Problem

Your beautiful desktop design breaks on mobile. Text is tiny, images overflow, navigation is unusable, buttons are too small to tap. You need layouts that adapt to any screen size. You need to optimize CSS for performance: faster page loads, smoother animations, better rendering.

### Explorable Questions

- Your site looks great on your laptop, but on mobile, users must pinch-zoom to read text. What `<meta>` tag and CSS units prevent this?
- You have a 3-column grid on desktop. On tablet, you want 2 columns. On mobile, 1 column. How do you use media queries to adapt the layout?
- Your images are 4000px wide, but mobile screens are only 400px. Loading full images wastes bandwidth. How do you serve different image sizes based on screen width?
- Your animations stutter and feel janky. DevTools shows layout recalculation. What CSS properties trigger reflow, and which are GPU-accelerated?
- Your stylesheet is 500KB because you imported an entire icon library but only use 3 icons. How do you reduce CSS file size?
- Users on slow connections see unstyled content for 2 seconds before CSS loads. How do you prevent render-blocking CSS?

### Build It: Fully Responsive Portfolio Site

Transform your portfolio into a mobile-first responsive site:

**Requirements:**

1. **Mobile-First Development**

   - Start with mobile styles (320px)
   - Add media queries for tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px)
   - Breakpoints based on content, not devices
   - Touch-friendly tap targets (44px minimum)

2. **Flexible Grid System**

   - CSS Grid that adapts: 1 column → 2 columns → 3 columns
   - Auto-fit and auto-fill for responsive columns
   - Minmax for flexible sizing
   - Grid gap that scales with viewport

3. **Responsive Typography**

   - Fluid typography using clamp()
   - Scale font sizes with viewport units (vw)
   - Readable line lengths (45-75 characters)
   - Proper hierarchy across devices

4. **Responsive Images**

   - Srcset and sizes attributes for resolution switching
   - Art direction with `<picture>` element
   - Lazy loading for off-screen images
   - CSS aspect ratio for image containers

5. **Responsive Navigation**

   - Desktop: Horizontal menu
   - Mobile: Hamburger menu
   - Smooth CSS transitions
   - Keyboard accessible

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Critical CSS inlined in `<head>`
   - Deferred non-critical CSS
   - Hardware-accelerated animations (transform, opacity)
   - CSS containment for faster rendering
   - Minimized reflows and repaints

**CSS Techniques Required:**

- Media queries (min-width, max-width, orientation, prefers-color-scheme)
- Flexbox with flex-wrap for responsive layouts
- CSS Grid with auto-fit/auto-fill
- Viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax)
- Clamp() for fluid sizing
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Transform and transition for animations
- Will-change for performance hints

**Testing Requirements:**

- Test on real devices (phone, tablet)
- Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Test with different viewport sizes
- Test with slow network (DevTools throttling)
- Lighthouse performance audit
- Ensure no horizontal scroll on any device

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Implement dark mode with prefers-color-scheme
- Add print-specific styles
- Honor prefers-reduced-motion for animations
- Container queries for component-level responsive design
- CSS aspect-ratio for responsive containers

### Reflection

After building:

- What's the difference between mobile-first and desktop-first approaches?
- Which CSS properties are safe to animate without performance issues?
- How do you balance responsive design with performance?
- When should you use viewport units vs percentage vs rem?

## 🔴 Expert: Architecture & Scale

### The Problem

Your CSS file is 10,000 lines. Multiple developers are working on it. Class names conflict. Specificity wars are constant. You're afraid to delete old styles because something might break. You need a methodology to organize, scale, and maintain CSS in large projects.

### Explorable Questions

- Your team has 5 developers writing CSS. Class names collide constantly. One dev names a button `.btn`, another names it `.button`. How do you prevent naming conflicts at scale?
- You have global styles, component styles, utility classes, and third-party library styles all fighting for specificity. How do you control the cascade so styles apply in a predictable order?
- Your CSS bundle is 500KB. Half the styles aren't even used. How do you identify and remove dead CSS? What tools help with tree-shaking?
- You're debating: BEM methodology, utility-first (Tailwind), CSS-in-JS, or CSS Modules. What are the trade-offs? When should you use each approach?
- Your app supports light and dark mode, and users can customize primary colors. How do you architect theming with CSS variables?
- Two rules apply to the same element with equal specificity. Which one wins? How do cascade layers (@layer) solve specificity problems?

### Build It: Scalable Design System

Create a comprehensive design system with architecture best practices:

**Requirements:**

1. **CSS Architecture**

   - Choose methodology: BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS, or utility-first

# JavaScript

## Section 1: Variables, Types & Coercion

### The Problem

You need to store and manipulate data in your web application: user input, API responses, calculations, states. JavaScript has different data types that behave differently. Sometimes JavaScript automatically converts types in surprising ways, causing bugs that are hard to debug.

### Explorable Questions

- You declare a variable with `var`, then accidentally redeclare it in a nested scope. The outer variable's value changes unexpectedly. How would `let` or `const` prevent this?
- You're storing user data. Some values should never change (user ID), others will change (user's current cart). When should you use `const` vs `let`?
- You receive data from an API. You check the type with `typeof`, but it says the data is "object" when you expected an array. Why does `typeof []` return "object"? How do you accurately check for arrays?
- Your calculation adds `"5" + 3` and gets `"53"` instead of 8. Then you try `"5" - 3` and get 2. Why does `+` behave differently than `-` with strings and numbers?
- You compare `[] == false` and it's `true`. Then you compare `[] === false` and it's `false`. What's the difference between `==` and `===`?
- You're storing integers larger than 9007199254740991 and they're losing precision. JavaScript shows wrong numbers. What data type handles arbitrarily large integers?

### Build It: Data Type Inspector Tool

Create an interactive tool that demonstrates JavaScript type system:

**Requirements:**

1. **Variable Declaration Comparison**

   - Input field for variable name and value
   - Three buttons: Declare with var, let, const
   - Show scope behavior in nested blocks
   - Demonstrate hoisting differences
   - Show errors when trying to reassign const

2. **Type Detection**

   - Input field for any value
   - Display typeof result
   - Show actual type (handle arrays, null, etc.)
   - Use instanceof for object types
   - Show constructor name

3. **Type Coercion Playground**

   - Two input fields for values
   - Buttons for operations: +, -, \*, /, ==, ===
   - Show result and explain coercion
   - Highlight unexpected behaviors
   - Show conversion steps

4. **Primitive Types Demo**

   - Examples of: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
   - Show literal syntax for each
   - Demonstrate immutability of primitives
   - Show wrapper objects (Number, String, Boolean)

5. **Reference Types Demo**
   - Object creation and manipulation
   - Array behavior
   - Demonstrate reference vs value
   - Show shallow vs deep copy
   - Memory diagram visualization

**Interactive Challenges:**

- "Fix the Bug": Provide code with type coercion bugs
- "Type Quiz": Guess the output of expressions
- "When to use const?": Scenarios requiring const vs let
- "Coercion Detective": Explain why expression equals what it does

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Add a comparison table: == vs ===
- Visualize type coercion rules
- Show IEEE 754 floating point precision issues
- Demonstrate BigInt arithmetic
- Show Symbol uniqueness

### Reflection

After building:

- Why does JavaScript have type coercion? What problems does it solve? What problems does it create?
- When is it safe to use `==`? When must you use `===`?
- Why are primitives immutable but objects are mutable?
- How does understanding var/let/const prevent bugs?

---

## Section 2: Control Flow & Logic

### The Problem

Your program needs to make decisions and repeat actions. If a user is logged in, show their dashboard; otherwise, show the login page. Loop through 100 products to find ones on sale. Handle different payment methods. Execute code conditionally based on user input or data.

### Explorable Questions

- You have a variable that could be 0, false, null, undefined, or "". You write `if (value)` to check if it exists, but it fails when value is 0. How do you check for null/undefined without excluding 0?
- Your switch statement falls through to multiple cases unexpectedly. You forgot something. What does `break` do, and when would you intentionally omit it?
- You're looping through an object's properties with `for...in` and getting unexpected inherited properties. How is `for...in` different from `for...of`? When should you use each?
- Your loop needs to skip certain iterations without stopping completely. What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?
- You're fetching multiple API endpoints. You use a regular `for` loop with `await`, but requests happen sequentially and take forever. How do `for await...of` loops handle async operations?
- You have nested if statements 5 levels deep. The code is unreadable. How can you refactor using switch, early returns, or guard clauses?

### Build It: Interactive Grading System

Create a student grading application with complex logic:

**Requirements:**

1. **Grade Calculator**

   - Input: Student scores for assignments, midterm, final
   - Calculate weighted grade (assignments 40%, midterm 30%, final 30%)
   - Assign letter grade using if/else: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)
   - Implement same logic with switch statement
   - Handle edge cases: negative scores, scores over 100, missing data

2. **Student List Management**

   - Array of student objects
   - Loop through students with for, while, do...while
   - Use for...in to iterate over object properties
   - Use for...of to iterate over student array
   - Demonstrate break and continue
   - Find specific students based on conditions

3. **Conditional Logic Challenges**

   - Determine if student qualifies for honor roll (GPA > 3.5 AND no grade below B)
   - Calculate scholarship eligibility (multiple conditions)
   - Show probation warnings (GPA < 2.0 OR 2 failing grades)
   - Use ternary operators for simple conditions
   - Use logical operators (&&, ||, !) for compound conditions

4. **Async Grade Processing**
   - Simulate fetching grades from API
   - Use for await...of to process async grade data
   - Show loading states during processing
   - Handle errors for failed requests

**Logic Patterns to Demonstrate:**

- Early returns to simplify nested conditions
- Guard clauses for validation
- Switch with fall-through for grouped cases
- Default cases for unexpected values
- Null/undefined checking
- Truthy/falsy evaluation

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Implement a grade curve algorithm
- Add GPA calculation across multiple semesters
- Create a grade trend analyzer (improving vs declining)
- Build a "what-if" calculator (what score needed on final for desired grade)

### Reflection

After building:

- When should you use switch vs if/else?
- What are the dangers of fall-through in switch statements?
- How do guard clauses improve code readability?
- When is a while loop better than a for loop?

---

## Section 3: Functions & Scope

### The Problem

You need to organize code into reusable blocks. Some code repeats (validate email format, format currency, calculate tax). Some logic is complex and should be isolated. You need to understand where variables are accessible and how functions can access variables from outer scopes.

### Explorable Questions

- You write a function that needs to access a variable from its outer scope. The variable changes after the function is defined. When you call the function later, which value does it see? This is closure - how does it work?
- Your function takes 5 parameters. Calling it is annoying because you must remember the order. You see a library where functions take an object instead: `createUser({ name, email, age })`. What's the advantage?
- You're using an API that expects a callback function. Inside the callback, `this` is undefined. You try using an arrow function and now it works. Why do arrow functions handle `this` differently?
- Your function calculates factorial recursively. For factorial(5), it works. For factorial(50000), the browser crashes with "Maximum call stack exceeded." What's happening?
- You need a function that remembers how many times it's been called, but you can't use global variables. How do closures enable private state?
- You're calling Array.prototype.map with a function, then Array.prototype.filter with another function. What makes these "higher-order functions"?

### Build It: Function Library & Closure Challenges

Create a utility library demonstrating function concepts:

**Requirements:**

1. **Basic Functions Collection**

   - Math utilities (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
   - Show function declaration vs function expression

- When should you use arrow functions vs regular functions?
- How do higher-order functions enable functional programming?
- What are the trade-offs between recursion and iteration?

## Section 4: Objects & Data Structures

### The Problem

You need to organize related data together. A user has a name, email, address, and preferences. A product has SKU, name, price, inventory, and images. You need to access, modify, add, and remove data. You need to transform data structures (arrays to objects, nested data to flat, etc.).

### Explorable Questions

- You fetch user data from an API as an object. You try to access `user.firstName` but it's undefined. The property is actually `user.first_name`. How do you safely access properties that might not exist? What's optional chaining?
- You have an array of products. You need to extract just the names into a new array. Should you use a for loop, map, filter, or reduce?
- You copy an object with `const copy = original`, then modify `copy.name`. The original object also changes! Why? How do you create a real copy?
- You have an array of objects (users). You need to find a specific user by ID, check if any users are admins, and verify if all users have email addresses. Which array methods do you use?
- You need to convert an array of [key, value] pairs into an object. Then convert an object into an array of [key, value] pairs. What methods do this?
- You need to combine two objects. Both have a `name` property. Which property wins? What's the spread operator doing?

### Build It: Data Transformation Dashboard

   - Store cart as array of product objects
   - Add items to cart (check for duplicates)
   - Update quantity (increment/decrement)
   - Remove items from cart
   - Calculate subtotal, tax, total using reduce
   - Apply discount codes
   - Sort by price, name, or quantity

4. **Data Transformation Tools**

   - Array to object conversion
   - Object to array conversion (entries, values, keys)
   - Flatten nested arrays
   - Group array items by property
   - Filter and transform in one operation
   - Chain multiple array methods

5. **Copying & Cloning**
   - Shallow copy with spread operator
   - Shallow copy with Object.assign

- What's the difference between shallow and deep copy? When does it matter?
- How does reduce enable so many different operations?
- Why is mutating arrays/objects sometimes problematic?

---

## Section 5: Asynchronous JavaScript

### The Problem

Your application needs to fetch data from servers, wait for user input, load images, read files, and perform time-consuming operations—without freezing the UI. JavaScript is single-threaded, but it can handle multiple operations with asynchronous code. Understanding promises, async/await, and the event loop is critical for modern web development.

### Explorable Questions

- You fetch data from an API. You need to use that data immediately after the fetch. You write `fetch(url)` then `console.log(data)`, but data is undefined. Why? How do promises let you handle async results?
- You have three API calls that don't depend on each other. You use `await` three times sequentially, and it takes 9 seconds. How can you run them in parallel and finish in 3 seconds?
- Your API request fails with a network error. Your app crashes. How do you catch errors in async/await code?
- You pass an async function to `setTimeout`. What happens? How does setTimeout interact with the event loop?
- You need to fetch data from 10 URLs. If any request fails, you want to retry it up to 3 times. How do you implement retry logic with exponential backoff?
- You're debouncing a search input (only search after user stops typing). How does setTimeout combined with clearing previous timeouts enable debouncing?

### Build It: Async Data Dashboard

Create an application demonstrating async patterns:

**Requirements:**

1. **Promise Fundamentals**

   - Create promises manually (resolve, reject)
   - Chain promises with .then()
   - Handle errors with .catch()
   - Use .finally() for cleanup
   - Show promise states (pending, fulfilled, rejected)

2. **Async/Await Patterns**

   - Convert promise chains to async/await
   - Handle errors with try/catch
   - Sequential async operations
   - Parallel async operations (Promise.all)
   - Race conditions (Promise.race)
   - Show syntax differences and readability

3. **Real API Integration**

   - Fetch data from public API (JSONPlaceholder, PokéAPI, etc.)
   - Display loading state while fetching
   - Show results after successful fetch
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Cache responses to avoid refetching

4. **Complex Async Flows**

   - Fetch data from multiple endpoints
   - Use Promise.all for parallel requests
   - Use Promise.race for timeout handling
   - Chain dependent requests (use result of first request in second)
   - Implement pagination (fetch next page)

5. **Timing & Debouncing**
   - Implement setTimeout for delayed execution
   - Implement setInterval for repeated execution
   - Clear timers to prevent memory leaks
   - Debounce user input (search as user types)
   - Throttle scroll events

**Real-World Features:**

- Search with autocomplete (debounced fetch)
- Infinite scroll pagination
- Retry failed requests with exponential backoff
- Timeout requests that take too long
- Loading indicators for async operations
- Error boundaries for failed requests

**Interactive Challenges:**

- "Fix the Race Condition": Multiple clicks cause duplicate requests
- "Async Flow Quiz": Predict execution order
- "Error Handling": Gracefully handle network failures
- "Performance": Optimize by parallelizing requests

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Implement a request queue (limit concurrent requests)
- Build a caching layer with expiration
- Create a polling system (fetch data every 5 seconds)
- Implement request cancellation (AbortController)
- Build a progress tracker for multiple async operations

### Reflection

After building:

- What's the difference between callbacks, promises, and async/await?
- When should you use Promise.all vs Promise.race?
- How does the event loop enable asynchronous JavaScript?
- What are the common pitfalls of async code?

---

## Section 6: DOM Manipulation & Events

### The Problem

Your HTML is static. You need to make it interactive: respond to clicks, update content dynamically, show/hide elements, validate forms, create elements with JavaScript, animate interactions. The DOM (Document Object Model) is how JavaScript interacts with HTML.

### Explorable Questions

- You select an element with `document.getElementById("button")` immediately after the `<script>` tag in the `<head>`. It returns `null`. Why? Where should the script be placed, or what should you wait for?
- You have 1000 list items. You add a click event listener to each one. The page is slow. How does event delegation solve this with a single listener on the parent?
- You update a paragraph's text with `innerText`, then someone tells you to use `textContent` instead. What's the difference? Why does `innerHTML` pose security risks?
- Your button has multiple event listeners (click, hover, focus). One of them calls `event.stopPropagation()`. What does this prevent?
- You're building a to-do app. When the user adds an item, you need to create a new `<li>` element, add text to it, add a delete button inside it, and append it to the list. How do you create elements with JavaScript?
- Your form submission causes a page reload. You want to handle it with JavaScript instead. What prevents the default browser behavior?

### Build It: Interactive To-Do Application

Create a fully functional to-do app with DOM manipulation:

**Requirements:**

1. **DOM Selection & Manipulation**

   - Select elements (getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll)
   - Change text content (textContent, innerText)
   - Change HTML content (innerHTML, but safely)
   - Modify attributes (setAttribute, getAttribute)
   - Add/remove/toggle CSS classes
   - Modify inline styles

2. **Creating Elements**

   - Create new elements (createElement)
   - Set properties and content
   - Add event listeners to new elements
   - Append to DOM (appendChild, append, insertBefore)
   - Remove elements (remove, removeChild)
   - Clone elements (cloneNode)

3. **Event Handling**

   - Click events (add to-do, delete to-do, toggle complete)
   - Form submit event (prevent default, get form data)
   - Input events (search/filter to-dos as user types)
   - Keyboard events (press Enter to submit)
   - Event delegation for dynamically created elements
   - Event object properties (target, currentTarget, preventDefault)

4. **To-Do App Features**

   - Add new to-dos with input field
   - Display to-dos in a list
   - Mark to-dos as complete (toggle class, strikethrough)
   - Delete to-dos (remove from DOM)
   - Edit to-dos (inline editing)
   - Filter to-dos (all, active, completed)
   - Count remaining to-dos
   - Clear all completed to-dos

5. **LocalStorage Integration**

   - Save to-dos to localStorage on every change
   - Load to-dos from localStorage on page load
   - Persist state across page refreshes
   - Handle JSON serialization/deserialization

6. **Advanced Interactions**
   - Drag and drop to reorder to-dos
   - Double-click to edit
   - Escape to cancel editing
   - Confirm before deleting all
   - Animations for add/remove (CSS transitions)

**Event Delegation Challenge:**

- Demonstrate problem: Individual listeners on 100 items vs single listener on parent
- Measure performance difference
- Show memory usage comparison

**Security Challenge:**

- Show XSS vulnerability with innerHTML
- Demonstrate safe alternatives (textContent, createElement)
- Sanitize user input before displaying

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Add drag-and-drop reordering
- Implement categories/tags for to-dos
- Add due dates with date picker
- Create priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Add undo functionality

### Reflection

After building:

- Why is event delegation more efficient than individual listeners?
- What's the difference between textContent and innerHTML? When should you use each?
- How does the event object help you build interactive UIs?
- What are the security implications of using innerHTML with user input?

## Section 7: Modern JavaScript Features

### The Problem

JavaScript has evolved significantly. Modern code uses ES6+ features that make code cleaner, more readable, and more powerful. You need to understand modules for code organization, modern syntax for concise code, error handling for robust applications, and how JavaScript manages memory.

### Explorable Questions

- You have a function with 8 lines just extracting object properties: `const name = user.name; const email = user.email;` etc. How does destructuring reduce this to one line?
- You're combining two arrays. You write a loop to push each element from one array into another. How does the spread operator accomplish this in one line?
- Your project has 20 JavaScript files. Variables from different files are conflicting. How do ES6 modules solve this with import/export?
- You call a function that might throw an error. You want to catch the error and show a user-friendly message instead of crashing. How does try/catch work?
- Your app is loading a 5MB library but only using 2 functions from it. How do named imports enable tree-shaking to reduce bundle size?
- You're formatting dates, numbers, and currencies for an international audience. How does the Intl API handle localization?

### Build It: Modern JavaScript Notes App

**Requirements:**

1. **Module System**

   - Split code into modules (app.js, note.js, storage.js, ui.js)
   - Use export/import (named and default exports)

   - Demonstrate tree-shaking (unused exports)

2. **Modern Syntax**

   - Destructuring (objects and arrays)
   - Spread operator (for arrays and objects)
   - Rest parameters (function arguments)
   - Template literals (string interpolation)
   - Arrow functions (concise syntax)
   - Optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)
   - Shorthand property names
   - Computed property names

3. **Classes & OOP**

   - Create Note class with constructor
   - Instance methods (save, update, delete)
   - Static methods (class-level utilities)
   - Inheritance (extend Note for different types)
   - Private fields (# syntax)
   - Getters and setters

4. **Error Handling**

   - try/catch for API calls
   - throw custom errors
   - finally for cleanup
   - Async error handling
   - Error boundaries for UI
   - Validation errors with helpful messages

5. **Internationalization**
   - Format dates (Intl.DateTimeFormat)
   - Format numbers (Intl.NumberFormat)
   - Format currencies (Intl.NumberFormat with currency)
   - Sort strings (Intl.Collator)
   - Relative time formatting
   - Pluralization rules

**App Features:**

- Create, read, update, delete notes
- Rich text editor (bold, italic, lists)
- Category/tag system for organization
- Search notes by title or content
- Sort notes (date created, date modified, alphabetically)
- Export notes to JSON
- Import notes from JSON
- Localize UI for different languages

**Code Organization:**

```
src/
  app.js (main entry point)

    Note.js (Note class)
  services/
    storage.js (localStorage wrapper)
    api.js (future API integration)
  utils/
    formatters.js (date, number formatting)
    validators.js (input validation)
  components/
    NoteEditor.js
    NoteList.js
    SearchBar.js
```

**Modern Patterns to Use:**

- Async/await throughout
- Destructuring in function parameters
- Spread for immutable updates
- Template literals for HTML generation
- Optional chaining for safe property access
- Nullish coalescing for default values

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Implement auto-save (debounced)
- Add version history (undo/redo)
- Implement offline-first with service workers
- Add collaborative editing (real-time updates)
- Create a browser extension version

### Reflection

After building:

- How do modules improve code organization and maintainability?
- What advantages do modern syntax features provide?
